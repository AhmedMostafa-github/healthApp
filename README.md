# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Tech stack used

- React Native
- Tamagui
- Reanimated

## Implementation approach

â€¢ **Component-Based Architecture with Tamagui UI Framework**: The app uses a modular component structure where each UI element (MoodSelector, Stepper, NotesInput, etc.) is built as a reusable component using Tamagui, a cross-platform UI library that provides consistent styling and theming across React Native platforms. The components are organized in a clear hierarchy with proper prop interfaces for type safety.

â€¢ **State Management with React Hooks**: The implementation relies heavily on React's built-in state management using useState hooks for local component state (mood selection, sleep hours, notes, dark mode toggle, etc.). The state is managed at the screen level and passed down to child components as props, following a top-down data flow pattern that's simple and predictable for this single-screen application.

â€¢ **Custom Animation System with Reanimated**: The app implements a sophisticated animation system using React Native Reanimated for the success feedback animation. This includes custom hooks (useSuccessAnimation) that manage complex animation states, interpolated values, and timing functions to create smooth, performant animations that enhance the user experience when completing a health check-in.
